# Text analysis of the "Politics" Stack Exchange"

This project was completed as part of a take-home exam. It assessed the posts and comments made by the three most "polarizing" users on the "Politics" Stack Exchange forum. The exam titled "Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning in Python" consisted of three parts and this project was completed as a response to the first part. It covers course content taught by Bernie Hogan in the class "Fundamentals for Social Data Science".
